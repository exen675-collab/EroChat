# EroChat

EroChat is a simple browser app for AI roleplay chat with automatic image generation.

It connects:
- **OpenRouter** for text replies
- **SwarmUI** for image generation

Now powered by a React frontend loaded from CDN (no local build step), no backend setup required.

## What it does

- Chat with custom characters
- Generate an image for each AI response (optional toggle)
- Create character thumbnails
- Save chats and settings in your browser
- Works on desktop and mobile layouts

## Quick start

### 1) What you need

- A modern browser
- An OpenRouter API key: https://openrouter.ai/
- A running SwarmUI instance (local or remote)

### 2) Run the app

Clone the repo and open it as static files:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd EroChat
python -m http.server 8080
```

Then open: `http://localhost:8080`

(You can also use any static server like `npx serve .`)

## Setup in the app

### OpenRouter

1. Paste your API key in Settings
2. Click **Fetch OpenRouter Models**
3. Pick a model

### SwarmUI (optional)

1. Enable image generation if you want automatic images
2. Make sure SwarmUI is running (default `http://localhost:7801`)
3. Update Base URL if needed
4. Click **Fetch Models**
5. Pick a model

If image generation is disabled, chat works without selecting a SwarmUI model.

## Characters

You can create multiple characters with their own:
- name + emoji/avatar
- system prompt
- optional generated thumbnail

Tip: for better thumbnails, write a clear visual description (style, hair, clothing, mood, etc.).

## Project structure

    └── react-app.js
```

## Privacy

- API keys stay in your browser storage
- Chat history stays in your browser storage
- Images are generated by your SwarmUI instance

## Troubleshooting

- **No reply from AI** → Check API key + selected OpenRouter model
- **No images** → Check SwarmUI URL, model selection, and server status
- **Slow responses** → Try a lighter model or lower generation settings
